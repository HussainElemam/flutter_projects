# Flutter Course Projects 🚀

This repository contains my implementations of the projects from the [**Flutter & Dart – The Complete Guide [2025 Edition]**](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

Each project demonstrates different Flutter concepts, from basic widgets to advanced state management and app architecture.
